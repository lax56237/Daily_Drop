=> first start all required files(react file and all server files)
=> then path 1 : "C:\Users\patel\AppData\Local\ngrok\ngrok.yml"
        path 2 : "C:\Users\patel\.ngrok2\ngrok.yml"
        onen these two files in notepade
=> then add all tunnels with their correct ports then save files
=> after this win + r press then open cmd in on any path and run this command 
   "ngrok start --all --config "C:\Users\patel\.ngrok2\ngrok.yml"
=> aftrer this we get all links which all are alternative of our links
=> all server (.js files) will work properly but react file eill not           
=> for work react file copy react's port url which ngrok provides us
   then open vite.config.js, past this url in origin and host part and save it, then react
   also works.
=> this is full vite.config.js (make sure this add when full project done!) 
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
